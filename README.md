## 🧐 Project Overview
Theatres have a reputation for being out of touch with the times when it comes to the digital world. Go to almost any theatre website, including really well-known theatres like [Steppenwolf](https://www.steppenwolf.org/) or [Goodman](https://www.goodmantheatre.org/), and you will feel transported back in time. Your eyes may start bleeding and you will start crying... wishing for someone, anyone, to have thought about you, the lowly user. We wanted to do something different. Why can't a theatre website be cutting-edge and sexy? From ticket sales, donations and class registrations to the off-site experience of simple and well-timed emails, it's the perfect opportunity to create a seamless, modern experience that makes users feel like they are really going to see something special when they walk through our doors. We wanted the online experience to be consistent with the experiences people have inside the theatre at one of our shows. And thus, a new website was born, built with the absolute latest web technologies available, crafted with love and intention. it's a website that truly says.. Welcome to The Nerve.
